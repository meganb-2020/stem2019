<h2>Founder of Birdies</h2>
<p>One of the keys to launching a successful brand is identifying the white space in an industry and creating the solution to a problem. In the case of Birdies, the slippers designed for indoor-outdoor wearability, the goal was flipping the script on the traditional indoor slipper and creating shoes that functioned for the home while doubling as luxe flats for the woman on the go.

With cofounders Bianca Gates (who has worked at Instagram and Facebook) and Marisa Sharkey (who worked in management consulting at Bain & Company) at the helm of the startup, a brick-and-mortar flagship in San Francisco, and a total of $10 million in funding so far, Birdies is taking flight as a power player in the footwear industry</p>
